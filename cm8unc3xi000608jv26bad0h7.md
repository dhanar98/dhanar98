# Laravel 5.1 to 12 Upgrade: PART 1

**Upgrading one of my client's old Laravel projects can feel like untangling a decade-old web of code**‚Äîespecially when jumping from Laravel 5.1 to 12. A direct upgrade seemed nearly impossible with so many breaking changes, outdated dependencies, and new architectural patterns.

At first, I considered upgrading step by step through each version, but that approach would have been time-consuming and error-prone. Instead, I discovered a more efficient method that saved time and reduced the complexity of fixing many errors.

Curious about how I pulled it off? Let‚Äôs dive into the smartest way to migrate from Laravel 5.1 to 12 without breaking everything!

## Hey Artisans! It‚Äôs Worth Upgrading to Laravel 12 ‚Äì Here‚Äôs Why

Sticking with Laravel 5.1 is making me uncomfortable in terms of security and performance, and it‚Äôs holding the application back.

#### **Security First!**

When considering the development of an application, security is the priority. Laravel 5.1 is **no longer supported**, meaning **zero security updates**. Running an old version is like leaving your front door wide open‚Äîupgrading keeps your app **secure and future-proof**

**Modern Development**

Compared to 5.1 to 12 - a lot of game-changing features are available in version 12 - blade components, query caching, and better improvement in Eloquent features.

#### **PHP 8+ Compatibility**

Laravel 5.1 runs on **PHP 5.5**, which is practically ancient. Laravel 12 takes full advantage of **PHP 8+**, bringing **better performance, type safety, and modern features**.

üîÑ **No More Upgrade Nightmares ‚Äì Avoid the Pain of Version-by-Version Torture!**

The longer you wait, the harder it gets. Upgrading in small steps (5.1 ‚Üí 5.5 ‚Üí 6 ‚Üí ‚Ä¶ ‚Üí 12) is painful. Instead, I took a different route‚ÄîI started fresh with **Laravel 12 and migrated my project piece by piece**. Spoiler alert: It saved me **tons of time and headaches!**

<div data-node-type="callout-emoji">üí°</div>
<div data-node-type="callout-text"><strong>NOTE:</strong></div>
</div>

**Many of the packages you relied on in Laravel 5.1 are now deprecated or no longer maintained. Instead of forcing outdated solutions to work, it's smarter to find modern, well-supported alternatives that align with Laravel 12‚Äôs ecosystem. Choosing the right replacements ensures better security, performance, and long-term support, saving you from future upgrade nightmares.**

Here‚Äôs a **detailed table** outlining the prerequisites required to upgrade from **Laravel 5.1 to Laravel 12.**

### **Prerequisites for Upgrading Laravel 5.1 to Laravel 12**

| **Requirement** | **Laravel 5.1** | **Laravel 12** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **PHP Version** | PHP 5.5 - 5.6 | PHP 8.2+ |
| **Composer Version** | Composer 1.x | Composer 2+ |
| **Carbon Version** | Carbon 1.x | Carbon 2+ |
| **Database Version** | MySQL 5.6 / MariaDB 10.0 | MySQL 8.x / MariaDB 10.4+ |
| **Cache Driver** | Redis 3.x, Memcached | Redis 6+, Memcached 1.6+ |
| **Laravel Version** | Laravel 5.1 | Laravel 12 |

This **table ensures clarity** by listing the changes in **Laravel 5.1 vs. Laravel 12**.

## Steps to Upgrade from Laravel 5.1 to Laravel 12

Since upgrading Laravel step by step from 5.1 to 12 is time-consuming and can introduce many breaking changes, the best approach is to **create a fresh Laravel 12 project** and migrate your old project files into it while fixing compatibility issues. Here‚Äôs how to do it:

### Step 1: Backup Your Old Laravel 5.1 Project

Before making any changes, create a full backup of your existing project.

### Step 2: Install Laravel 12 in a New Directory

To get a clean Laravel 12 installation, run:

```bash
composer create-project laravel/laravel project_name
```

Navigate into the new project directory:

```bash
cd project_name
```

### **Step 3: Configure New Laravel 12 Project**

#### Copy the `.env` file from your Laravel 5.1 project and update it in the new Laravel 12 project:

```bash
cp /path/to/old_project/.env .env
```

Update the database credentials inside `.env` to match your existing database.

### Step 4: Run the application in version 12:

After the installation in version 12, execute the command

```bash
php artisan serve
```

otherwise, configure it in Nginx or Apache to run.

After the Successful check, the application is working properly with a welcome page without any errors.

### **Step 5: Migrate Your Old Codebase**

üéâ **Congratulations! Your Laravel 12 Project is Live... But Hold On!**

You might be tempted to throw all your old files into the new project at once‚Äî**DON‚ÄôT DO IT!**

Laravel 12 has a **different directory structure**, so dumping everything in without a plan will only lead to **"White Screen of Death" nightmares**.

Instead, follow this **error-proof migration order** to avoid breaking the welcome page:

* **Move Your Models First** ‚Äì Laravel 12 keeps models inside `app/Models`. If yours are still chilling in `app/`, give them a new place
    
* **Bring in Your Controllers** - Place them inside `app/Http/Controllers/`, and don‚Äôt forget to update namespaces to `App\Http\Controllers;`
    
* **Routes Come Next** ‚Äì Laravel 5.1 had a single `routes.php` file, but Laravel 12 has `routes/web.php` and `routes/api.php`. Split them accordingly. Also, initially, comment all your routes other than the welcome page route endpoint
    
* **Migrate Your Views** ‚Äì Drop your Blade templates into `resources/views/`, but watch out for deprecated Blade syntax changes!
    
* **Config & Middleware** ‚Äì Copy over necessary config files from `config/` and move your middleware into `app/Http/Middleware/`
    

**Composer & Migrations** ‚Äì Run `composer install`, `php artisan migrate`, and clear cache (`php artisan cache:clear`) to make sure everything is running smoothly.

Now, refresh your browser‚Ä¶ and BAM! **Your Laravel 12 app is alive without a single ‚ÄúWhoops‚Äù error!**

Now, the welcome page only shows the need to fix the issues one by one based on version upgrade changes in version 12 of every class.

### Change the key in .env in Laravel for Cache Config

In the upgrade process, the first change is that we are updating the key name for the default cache configuration

```yaml
# laravel 5.1
CACHE_DRIVER =file

# laravel v12.0
CACHE_STORE = file
```

This is an example of changes based on your need change the cache store management also do the changes in `cache.php` config folder.

### Route Config Changes in Laravel 12

* In Laravel 5.1, the routes are added `routes.php` and loaded via `RouteServiceProvider.php`  
    But in the new version, you only need to do the changes for the version 12 requirement.
    
* In Laravel 12, there is no more `RouteServiceProvider.php` Some of the defining method changes need to be done in your laravel version 5.1 migrated file in the `web.php`
    

If your application is Web, add the routes in `web.php` If it is API, add the routes in `api.php`  
by default `web.php` file will be in the config folder, but if you need to use the `api.php` file, you may install additional route files for API routes

```yaml
php artisan install:api
```

load all your routes from the `bootstrap/app.php` like this

```php
<?php

use Illuminate\Foundation\Application;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Configuration\Exceptions;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Configuration\Middleware;

return Application::configure(basePath: dirname(__DIR__))
    ->withRouting(
        web: __DIR__.'/../routes/web.php',
        api: __DIR__.'/../routes/api.php',
        commands: __DIR__.'/../routes/console.php',
        health: '/up',
    )
    ->withMiddleware(function (Middleware $middleware) {
        //
    })
    ->withExceptions(function (Exceptions $exceptions) {
        //
    })->create();
```

need to update your app.php file.

### Middleware changes in Laravel 12

Middleware in Laravel acts like a **security checkpoint** for your application. It filters HTTP requests **before they reach your controllers**.

All the middleware moved `app/Http/Middleware` no artisan command is available 5.1 now it is available

```yaml
php artisan make:middleware MiddlewareName
```

All the middleware is configured in the app.php file; the kernel.php is no longer in the project v-12

all the middlewares configured in laravel 5.1 now need to add in the app.php those are already configured.

If your custom middleware is available, add this in app.php file based on the need of web and api

```php
use App\Http\Middleware\WebMiddleware;
use App\Http\Middleware\ApiMiddleware;

->withMiddleware(function (Middleware $middleware) {
    $middleware->group('web', [
        WebMiddleware::class,
    ]);
    $middleware->group('api' [
        ApiMiddleware::class,
    ]);
})
```

If the custom middlewares are added with alias class, change it to this format

```php
use App\Http\Middleware\AliasMiddleware;

->withMiddleware(function (Middleware $middleware) {
    $middleware->alias([
        'alias' => AliasMiddleware::class
    ]);
})
```

## Route Changes in Laravel 12

### **Route Definition Syntax Changes**

#### Laravel 5.1:

Routes were defined in the `app/Http/routes.php` file.

```php
Route::get('home', 'HomeController@index');
```

#### Laravel 12:

The `routes/web.php` and `routes/api.php` files are used instead.

```php
use App\Http\Controllers\HomeController;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;

Route::get('home', [HomeController::class, 'index']);
```

**Key Changes:**

* No more `routes.php` (moved to `web.php` and `api.php`).
    
* Controllers must be referenced using `::class`.
    

### **Middleware Application**

#### Laravel 5.1:

Middleware was applied directly within the `routes.php` file like this:

```php
Route::get('admin', ['middleware' => 'auth', 'uses' => 'AdminController@index']);
```

#### Laravel 12:

Middleware is applied using a cleaner syntax:

```php
Route::middleware(['auth'])->group(function () {
    Route::get('admin', [AdminController::class, 'index']);
});
```

**Key Changes:**

* Middleware is applied **using groups** for better readability.
    
* The array syntax is no longer used.
    

### **API Routes & Versioning**

#### Laravel 5.1:

API routes were mixed with web routes, leading to complexity.

```php
Route::get('api/users', 'Api\UserController@index');
```

#### Laravel 12:

API routes are now defined separately in `routes/api.php`, and **route versioning** is recommended.

```php
use App\Http\Controllers\Api\UserController;

Route::prefix('v1')->group(function () {
    Route::get('users', [UserController::class, 'index']);
});
```

**Key Changes:**

* `routes/api.php` separates API routes from web routes.
    
* **Versioning (**`v1`, `v2`) allows better API management.
    
* manage this versioning is easy in app.php configuration also.
    

### **Named Routes Syntax Changes**

#### Laravel 5.1:

Named routes were defined using an array.

```php
Route::get('profile', ['as' => 'profile', 'uses' => 'ProfileController@index']);
```

#### Laravel 12:

Named routes are now applied using `name()`

```php
Route::get('profile', [ProfileController::class, 'index'])->name('profile');
```

**Key Changes:**

* **No more array syntax** `name()` is used instead.
    

### **Route Model Binding Enhancements**

Laravel 5.1:

Manual fetching of models was required in controllers.

```php
Route::get('user/{id}', function ($id) {
    return User::findOrFail($id);
});
```

#### Laravel 12:

Implicit **Route Model Binding** automatically fetches the model.

```php
Route::get('user/{user}', function (User $user) {
    return $user;
});
```

### Migration File Structure Changes

Updating an Existing Migration files the moved files from version 5.1 need to be upgraded as using anonymous class. This will avoid a naming collision

```php
return new class extends Migration {
    public function up(): void {
        Schema::table('users', function (Blueprint $table) {
            $table->string('phone')->nullable();
        });
    }

    public function down(): void {
        Schema::table('users', function (Blueprint $table) {
            $table->dropColumn('phone');
        });
    }
};
```

### File System Changes (`config/filesystems.php`)

Need to upgrade the default filesystem driver in `.env` and make the changes in composer.json

```yaml
# composer.json
{
    "require": {
        "php": "^8.1",
        "laravel/framework": "^12.0",
        "guzzlehttp/guzzle": "^7.7",
        "league/flysystem": "^3.0", 
        "aws/aws-sdk-php": "^3.0"
    }
}
```

then run the command to update composer.json

### Query Execution Changes

**Old DB Facade Usage**

In **Laravel 5.1**, the `DB` facade was commonly used like this:

```php
use DB;
```

**Laravel 12** (Modern DB Facade Usage)

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\DB;
```

### **Raw Queries Were More Prone to SQL Injection**

```php
#version 5.1
$users = DB::select("SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '" . $email . "'");
```

### **Laravel 12: Uses Safer Parameter Binding**

* Uses **prepared statements** to prevent SQL injection
    

```php
$users = DB::select("SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ?", [$email]);
```

search all over the place `app()‚Üíenvioronment()` and replace it to `config(‚Äòapp.env‚Äô)`

### Conclusion of Part 1: The Upgrade Journey Begins

Upgrading from Laravel 5.1 to Laravel 12 might seem like a massive leap, but taking the right approach makes all the difference. Instead of struggling with step-by-step version upgrades, we took a **clean slate approach**‚Äîsetting up a fresh Laravel 12 project and migrating essential parts of the old application.

So far, we‚Äôve covered **why upgrading is worth it, prerequisites, project setup, and file migration strategies** to ensure a smooth transition without unexpected errors. But the journey doesn‚Äôt end here!

In **Part 2**, I‚Äôll dive deeper into the **core changes** you need to tackle, including **models, Blade components, request handling, database modifications, and package deprecations**‚Äîalong with real-world challenges I faced (and how I solved them).

Stay tuned for the next phase of this Laravel upgrade adventure!
